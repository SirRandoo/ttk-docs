# Setting Up {{ site.data.mods.ttk.name }}

Setting up {{ site.data.mods.ttk.name }} can be a fairly arduous task as fine
tuning its settings to your own personal preferences can be a series of trial
and error that can span hours to months. The hope of this documentation is that
you'll have a better sense of what each individual setting within
{{ site.data.mods.ttk.name }} does, and how it may affect other systems within
the mod. With all that in mind, the documentation for
{{ site.data.mods.ttk.name }} will be broken up into various smaller, more
manageable chunks; with some chunks being broken down further due to their
complex nature. You can see a brief overview of what topics will be covered here
through the sidebar or the table of contents below.
