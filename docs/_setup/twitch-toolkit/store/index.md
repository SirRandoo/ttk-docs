There are various types of things viewers can purchase in
{{ site.data.mods.ttk.name }} (and {{ site.data.mods.utils.name }}) that range
from in-game items to traits for pawns assigned to a given viewer. Due to the

{{ site.data.mods.utils.name }}, this section of the documentation will also be
broken up into more specific chunks for every different category of purchasable
content.
