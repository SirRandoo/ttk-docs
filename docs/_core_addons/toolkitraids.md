{{ page.title }} is an addon for
{% workshop id: site.data.mods.core.id, name: site.data.mods.core.name %}. This
addon creates raids when a streamer raids another streamer. Viewers can join
these raids and appear in-game as a raider. While viewers aren't able to modify,
or otherwise inspect their raiders, they can still watch an in-game character
attempt to raid the colony.

We won't go over the settings menu for this addon as it has descriptions of what
each setting does, but here's a picture of the settings menu for an idea of
what you can configure within the addon:
