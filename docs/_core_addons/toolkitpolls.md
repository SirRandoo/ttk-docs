{{ page.title }} is an addon for
{% workshop id: site.data.mods.ccore.id, name: site.data.mods.ccore.name %}.
This addon provides a framework for other addons to create polls, and provides
an adapter for converting {{ site.data.mods.cttk.name }} polls into
{{ page.title }} polls. This means that you can use any
{{ site.data.mods.ccore.name }} addons that have polls, like
{{ site.data.mods.research.name }}, without having their polls clash with
{{ site.data.mods.cttk.name }}'s polls. For this reason, it's highly recommended
you also install this addon if you have clashing polls.

We won't go over the settings menu for this addon as it has descriptions of what
each setting does, but here's a picture of the settings menu for an idea of
what you can configure within the addon:
