{{ page.title }} is an addon for
{% workshop id: site.data.mods.ttk.id, name: site.data.mods.ttk.name %}. This
addon gives viewers a configurable amount of lootboxes when they chat in your
stream for the first time a day. Each lootbox award a random amount of coins
depending on the maximum and minimum amount of coins set within the addon's
settings. The settings menu should look something like this:

{% image src: "lootboxes-settings.png",
        alt: site.data.images.alt.lootboxes.settings %}

This documentation won't go over the settings for the addon since they're fairly
self-explanatory, but in the event you do need help with the addon you can join
the [{{ site.data.mods.ttk.name }} discord]({{- site.discord_url -}}) for
support.
