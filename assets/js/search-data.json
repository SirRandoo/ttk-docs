This means that you cannot use accounts like nightbot, streamelements, streamlabs, moobot, etc.. | Bot username | OAuth token | Channel | . Bot Username . This text field is where you would put the username of the account on Twitch. While this field is somewhat unimportant since Twitch uses the username associated with the OAuth token, it’s still a good idea to put something here as other parts of the mod may use this field to display certain information. Earlier version of Twitch Toolkit supported using links as a username, but the current version of Twitch Toolkit does not. You will have to put in the username of the account the token was generated for, or the mod will not work properly if at all. OAuth Token . This text field is the important bit that allows the mod to connect to Twitch. You can click the “New OAuth token” button near the field if you don’t already have one. You can either manually paste it into the text field by clicking the “Show” button, or you can have the mod fill in the field from your clipboard by clicking the “Paste from clipboard” button. Clicking the “New OAuth Token” will take you to a convenient website that will generate a token for the Twitch account you’re currently logged into. This website isn’t affiliated with Twitch Toolkit, or its developers, and only serves as a user-friendly way of creating a token. In the end you should have a bunch of nonsensical text that starts with oauth:, which you should paste into the mod’s settings menu (including the oauth: portion). Channel . This text field is where you’ll type in the username of the channel you want the bot to listen to. You can put any channel you own, or otherwise have permission to use for the bot. Earlier version of Twitch Toolkit supported using links as a channel, but the current version of Twitch Toolkit does not.

The first setting (“Allow viewers to whisper”) determines whether the bot will also read any messages whispered to it. This means that any command whispered to the bot will also run the code associated with said command. However this does not mean the bot will respond to a whisper as a whisper message. Whispering users on Twitch is heavily limited and only allows for a certain number of unique users to be whispered within a given day. For the exact number of users, you can review the documentation for whispering here. The second setting (“Force viewers to whisper”) determines whether the bot will only handle messages sent through whispers. With this setting on no messages sent through the channel’s chat will be processed. If viewers are forced to whisper, but whispers aren’t enabled in the bot’s settings, viewers will not be able to use any commands.

For more information about the settings you can read the relevant documentation for the purchase system that governs the setting. The expanded menu should look something like: . Karma Type . The karma type setting can be used to change the karma type of the purchase. Changing the karma type for a given purchase will affect how much a viewer’s karma will increase or decrease. For more information about the karma system, and how it affects viewers, you can read the relevant documentation for it here. Other variants of this setting can be found in items that match certain conditions. When these conditions are met, a new setting unique to a specific type of purchase will be visible. Below are a list of those conditions and the setting that becomes visible when said condition is met: . | Condition | Setting | . | Apparel | Karma type for wearing | . | Consumables | Karma type for using | . | Weapons | Karma type for equipping | . Purchase Weight . The purchase weight setting can be used to change how much a single item weights in regards to karma calculations. An item with a higher weight will more drastically affect a viewer’s karma when bought, while an item with a lower weight will less drastically affect a viewer’s karma when bought. For more information about the karma system, and how it affects viewers, you can read the relevant documentation for it here. Quantity Limit . The quantity limit setting can be used to change how many items a viewer can buy at once. Any purchase made with a quantity higher than the limit will still succeed, but with the quantity lowered to the limit. This means that if an item has a limit of 30, and a viewer wants to purchase 90, the purchase will succeed and they will only purchase 30. As this setting directly affects how many items a viewer can buy, it can clash with the minimum amount of coins a viewer has to spend in order to purchase anything from the store. If the minimum amount is 50 coins, and an item that costs 49 coins has a quantity limit of 1, viewers will not be able to purchase said item until one of the two settings are adjusted to compensate for the other.

The “UUID” column, which stands for Universally Unique Identifier, is where you put the id of the channel point reward on Twitch. You can get the id for a channel point reward by clicking the accompanying . Amount . The “amount” column is the amount of Twitch Toolkit coins when the viewer redeems the channel point reward.
