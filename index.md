Welcome to the documentation for
{% workshop id: site.data.mods.ttk.id, name: site.data.mods.ttk.name %}.
{{ site.data.mods.ttk.name }} is an interactivity mod for the game
[RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com/) that allows viewers to influence the game
through the mod's currency system, as well through polls viewers can vote on.

{: .important}
For the sake of sanity, this documentation assumes you have
{% workshop id: site.data.mods.utils.id, name: site.data.mods.utils.name %}
installed as it overhauls most of {{ site.data.mods.ttk.name }}, and I don't
want to write documentation for, essentially, two different versions of
{{ site.data.mods.ttk.name }}.
